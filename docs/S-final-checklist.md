## Verification Steps
1. ✅ All main fuses installed and correctly rated  
2. ✅ Battery negative grounded firmly; bus bar intact  
3. ✅ All wiring secured, routed, and insulated  
4. ✅ No loose strands, no tools left near conductors  
5. ✅ Terminal covers and shrink installed  
6. ✅ Battery voltage and polarity confirmed  
7. ✅ Inverter / charger settings verified

## First-Power Procedure
- Connect a **small test load** (lamp or resistor bank).  
- Observe voltage drop and temperature rise for several minutes.  
- If all stable → enable larger equipment gradually.

:::warning
Never energize a circuit until every checklist item is verified.  
One missed fuse or reversed wire can destroy an entire system.
