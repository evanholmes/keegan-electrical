# P — Safety “Do Not” List

These are non-negotiable rules. Violate them = damage or injury.

1. **Do not** run battery positive without a fuse within inches of the source.  
2. **Do not** mix battery chemistries or ages in parallel.  
3. **Do not** use capacitors with lower voltage ratings.  
4. **Do not** measure live circuits on resistance / diode mode.  
5. **Do not** jump MOSFET gates with a battery—use meter diode-mode only.  
6. **Do not** ignore heat—hot = high resistance.  
7. **Do not** trust color coding—verify with a meter every time.

Confirm every connection before applying power.
