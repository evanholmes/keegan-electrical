# O â€” Assembly Best Practices

## Wiring integrity
- Crimped joints outlast soldered ones in vibration zones.  
- Use correct die for gauge; perform a pull test.  
- Heat-shrink (adhesive-lined) all joints.  

## Cable routing
- Run wires along frame rails with loom and P-clamps.  
- Avoid sharp edges; use grommets where needed.  
- Label both ends with heat-shrink or vinyl tags.  
- Support heavy cables every 30 cm / 12 in or less.

## Battery area
- Keep box ventilated and covered.  
- Insulate all exposed terminals.  
- Lock the box if in public installations.
