# N â€” Common Failure Patterns

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Corrective Action |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| No power | blown fuse, open switch | replace fuse, confirm continuity |
| Re-blowing fuses | shorted load or wrong fuse | isolate load, bench-test |
| Voltage drop | loose or undersized wire | re-crimp, upsize wire |
| Intermittent faults | vibration, loose connectors | tighten, add lock washers |
| Burnt PCB parts | reversed polarity or over-V | repair circuit, add reverse protection |

:::important
Heat at connectors = resistance.  **Hot = failing.**
