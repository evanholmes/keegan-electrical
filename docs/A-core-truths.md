# A — Core truths (short & non-negotiable)

**V (volts)** = pressure  
**A (amps)** = flow  
**Ω (ohms)** = restriction  
**W (watts)** = V × A (power = heat)

:::warning Fuse protects wire
Size the fuse to the wire. Fuse at the source, as close to the battery or panel as practical.
:::

- Disconnects and breakers are convenient switches; fuses are last-resort safety.  
- If a wire gets warm, it’s undersized — fix it immediately.  
- Test with power **off** for continuity and resistance.  
- Use meter-only gate charging for MOSFET checks.  
- Never apply a battery to an unknown circuit during testing.
