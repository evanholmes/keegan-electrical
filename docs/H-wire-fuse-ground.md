:::important Fuse sizing
Match fuse to the **wire ampacity**, never above it.  
Use slow-blow types only where inrush currents require it.

## Grounding
- Ground wire = same gauge as positive feed.  
- Bolt to **bare metal**, use star washer + grease.  
- Prefer **star topology**—one central return point.

---

## Connectors & Crimps
- Ring terminals for lugs; crimp > solder in high-vibration areas.  
- Use adhesive heat-shrink.  
- Secure heavy cables every 12 in or less.  
- Use locking connectors for moving assemblies.
