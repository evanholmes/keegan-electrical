# L — Multimeter Quick Playbook

## Always
- Set correct **range** and **jacks** for the mode.  
- Voltage first → continuity/resistance only when power OFF.  
- Use diode mode for semiconductors.  
- Use an ESR meter for capacitors when possible.

## Key Procedures
### Voltage-Drop Test
Measure at source and load under current.  
Δ V > 0.5 V (on 12 V systems) → bad connection or undersized wire.

### Ground-Short Search
Insert meter or clamp in series; pull fuses one by one until current falls.  
Typical parasitic draw < 0.1 A when idle.

### Diode Test
Forward 0.5–0.7 V (Si) 0.2–0.4 V (Schottky).  
Reverse = OL.

### Continuity
Audible beep = < ≈ 50 Ω.  
Use only with power off.

:::tip
Label your meter leads “V / Ω” and “A” and store wrapped—broken leads cause most measurement errors.
